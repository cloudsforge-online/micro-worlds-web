        surfaces with none, and the registry's `developers` row has been claiming all along that
        the developer console is "reached from the footer" — a navigation path that existed
        nowhere. Every link in it is derived from SURFACES, so a new product appears here without
        this file changing.

        `account` is passed for one reason: it decides whether the operator surfaces are offered.
        Omitting it would hide them, which is safe, but this app already knows and a signed-in
        operator should be able to reach Admin from any page.
