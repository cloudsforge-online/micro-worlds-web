/**
 * The boot sequence. The order is not arbitrary.
 *
 *   1. Observability first, so an exception thrown by anything below is reported rather than lost.
 *      A crash during the first render is the single most valuable event this app can send.
 *   2. `bootstrapSession()` second, and AWAITED, so the SSO hand-off code in the URL fragment is
 *      redeemed before React mounts. It strips `#cf_code` from the address bar before the exchange
 *      goes over the wire — see the note in @cloudsforge/ui. Rendering first would show a
 *      signed-out shell to somebody who has just signed in, and would leave the code on screen for
 *      the length of a network round trip.
 *   3. Render last.
