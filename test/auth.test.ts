/**
 * Reading the player out of `/auth/me`, in the shape identity actually answers.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * A DEFECT THAT IS FIXED, AND A TEST THAT KEEPS IT FIXED.
 *
 * Identity answers `{ user: {...}, session: {...}, organisations: [...] }` — the profile is NESTED
 * under `user` (`identity/src/server.ts`, body built by `toPublicUser` at
 * `identity/src/users.ts`; both re-read against the source for this repository).
 *
 * The web template once declared `interface Me { handle?, roles? }` and read both fields off the
 * TOP level, where they are not, and four frontends inherited it: `roles` was always null, `isAdmin`
 * in the shared company bar was always false, and the switcher hid every `adminOnly` entry from
 * every signed-in operator.
 *
 * **That is fixed upstream now** — `micro-web-template/src/lib/auth.tsx` declares the nested
 * shape and lines 98-99 read `me?.user?.handle` and `me?.user?.roles`, and hub-web, site,
 * foresight-web, foresight-admin-web and market-web all match. So this file is not a correction of
 * anybody; it is the assertion that stops the reading drifting BACK, plus the flat fallback the
 * template does not carry, for a proxy or an older build on the rollback path.
