/**
 * Pressing Testnet re-reads THIS page from the testnet estate, without going anywhere.
 *
 *     "i see basically that in every page when you press testnet it take you to network page
 *      testet and if you switch product its reset to mainnet"
 *
 * The report that made this a defect in every bundle rather than in three of them (micro-org#459).
 * What this file pins is the one thing the reader can see: the base URL this app reads from
 * follows the SWITCHER, not the address bar, and it goes back when they switch back.
 *
 * No DOM. `lib/viewed.ts` holds the choice in module memory and `lib/hosts.ts` consults it per
 * request, so a stub window at a hostname is the entire environment this needs.
 *
 * The state is a MODULE's, so it outlives the test that set it — hence the reset in `afterEach`,
 * performed through the public setter with a window installed, because `setViewedNetwork`
 * normalises its argument against the hostname's own network.
