/**
 * A frontend ships its own browser chrome, or it ships none at all.
 *
 * FOUR FINISHED FRONTENDS SHIPPED WITH NO FAVICON AT ALL and went green in CI, because nothing
 * anywhere asserted that a page has an icon (18-build-status.md §3.3e). The checks below are the
 * template's, kept in both directions and unweakened.
 *
 * ── This surface DOES ship an og card, and that is the decision rather than the default ────────
 *
 * `micro-admin-web` asserts the deliberate ABSENCE of one, because §3.3k recorded that nobody
 * shares an operator console outward. The same paragraph draws the opposite conclusion for public
 * surfaces, and Forge Worlds is a clear case in the estate: a title page exists to be sent
 * to somebody. `brand/assets/worlds/` holds `og-1200x630.png`, so it is shipped, linked, and
 * asserted here — in both directions, so removing it later fails the build.
 *
 * ── And the icons must reach the IMAGE, not only the repository ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The last two tests are the ones that matter most on this surface. The web template's Dockerfile
 * once did not copy `public/`, so every frontend cut from it built an image whose `dist/` had no
 * icons — while a test exactly like this one passed, because it reads the SOURCE tree. That is
 * fixed upstream (`micro-web-template/Dockerfile:39`) and in every frontend, so the tests below
 * are a guard rather than a correction. They are still worth their lines: reading a Dockerfile is
 * not evidence that an image serves a file, which is why the second of them requires CI to CURL
 * the running container. Here a missing public/ would also 404 `og:image` and blank the link
 * preview on every shared title page.
