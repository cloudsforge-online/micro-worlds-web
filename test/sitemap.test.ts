/**
 * The sitemap and robots.txt nginx serves for this surface.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THE BODIES ARE IN nginx.conf AT ALL
 *
 * A sitemap must carry ABSOLUTE URLs — the spec requires it and a crawler discards a relative
 * `<loc>` — and nothing built in this repository may name a hostname, because one image is served
 * from localhost, from a preview deployment and from `worlds.<apex>`.
 * `test/no-build-time-config.test.ts` is that rule; this is the one document that cannot obey it
 * and be useful at the same time.
 *
 * nginx is the component that can. It has `$host` on every request, so the addresses are composed
 * per request and the artefact stays environment-free.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * AND WHY THIS SURFACE DOES NOT USE `sitemapXml()` FROM THE DESIGN SYSTEM
 *
 * THE SHARED GENERATOR IS FOR THE APEX. It composes each sibling surface as `<subdomain>.$host`,
 * which is right on the marketing site, where `$host` IS the apex. Here `$host` is already
 * `worlds.<apex>`, so the same call would emit `network.worlds.<apex>` — the two-label shape
 * `@cloudsforge/ui/surfaces.ts` records at length as unreachable, because the edge's Universal SSL
 * is a one-label wildcard and every two-label name fails the handshake.
 *
 * So this surface publishes ITS OWN public routes, derived from the same `ROUTES` table the
 * navigation, the router and nginx's enumerated locations all come from — and `robots.txt`, which
 * has no such problem, IS generated from the design system and compared byte for byte.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * AND WHY EITHER NEEDS A TEST
 *
 * A body pasted into a config file is a copy, and this estate has been bitten by exactly one of
 * those: `site/index.html`'s title drifted from its application's, the suite stayed green, and
 * every search result carried a sentence the owner had asked to have removed until somebody opened
 * the served HTML rather than the page. The block below is therefore treated as GENERATED OUTPUT
 * that happens to live in a config file.
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
