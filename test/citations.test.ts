/**
 * EVERY CITATION IN THIS REPOSITORY NAMES A FILE THAT EXISTS, AND NAMES NO LINE IN IT.
 *
 * This bundle is documented by citation: over three hundred paths into `worlds/src/server.ts`,
 * `worlds/src/provisioning.ts`, `worlds/src/titleclient.ts`, `lantern/src/rum.ts` and more. A citation
 * is the estate's unit of evidence and it decays silently, so it needs a check — and the README
 * template says why in one line: "A claim nobody can check is worse than no claim, because it is
 * believed."
 *
 * Until today those citations carried a LINE NUMBER, and that is the failure this file now exists
 * to prevent. A line number names a position in a file that a DIFFERENT repository owns and is free
 * to edit. micro-trade inserted seven lines near its imports and every route below moved, so every
 * citation into it broke while nothing in the citing repository was wrong — and nothing runs this
 * suite when a service changes, so it surfaced during a release rather than at the edit. Seven of
 * nineteen CI failures across the estate on 2026-08-06 were that one shape.
 *
 * What replaces it is the file, plus the SYMBOL when a reader needs the exact place. A symbol moves
 * with the code; a line does not.
 *
 * When a sibling is not checked out, the citations into it are REPORTED as unchecked rather than
 * passed over in silence, so a green run never implies more than it measured.
