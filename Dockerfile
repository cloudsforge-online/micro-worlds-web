# Two stages: build the bundle, then serve it. The final image contains no Node, no toolchain, no
# source and no secret — an SPA is static files, and everything else in the image is attack
# surface for something it does not need to do.
#
# THE IMAGE CARRIES NO ENVIRONMENT. It is built once, tagged once, and the same tag is promoted
# from staging to production; the hosts it talks to are resolved in the browser from the address
# the page was served on. There is deliberately no build arg for an API URL, and adding one would
# undo the property this template exists to keep.

# The named context is the unpublished @cloudsforge/ui workspace, mirroring the `link:` specifier
# in package.json. It disappears when the package is published; see "The one temporary thing" in
# the README.

# public/ — THE LINE THAT ONCE WAS NOT IN THE TEMPLATE.
#
# Vite copies `publicDir` into `dist` during the build, so the favicons and the og card only reach
# the image if they are in the build context. The web template's Dockerfile used to copy tsconfig,
# vite.config, index.html and src — and not public — so every frontend cut from it built an image
# whose `dist/` had no favicon in it, while `brand-chrome.test.ts` went on passing because it reads
# the SOURCE tree. Four frontends shipped that way: icons wired, committed, tested, and absent from
# the artefact actually served.
#
# It is fixed upstream now (`micro-web-template/Dockerfile:39`), and every frontend in the estate
# carries the line — so this comment records a closed defect rather than an open one. The reason to
# keep saying it is that a copy is only as good as the check under it: on THIS surface a missing
# public/ would also 404 `og:image` and blank the link preview on every shared title page, which
# nothing about the source tree would reveal. Both `test/brand-chrome.test.ts` (which reads this
# file) and the image probe in ci.yml (which curls the RUNNING container for each asset) fail
# without this line.
